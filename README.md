The [Environmental Enforcement Watch (EEW)](https://www.environmentalenforcementwatch.org/) is a project of the [Environmental Data & Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) receiving 2021 ESIP Lab funding for the project "Developing an Environmental Enforcement Data Portal for Grassroots and Congressional Action".

# Project Description
Vital data about federal environmental enforcement actions against facilities that pollute the soil, air, and water is currently available but largely inaccessible in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) [Enforcement and Compliance History Online (ECHO) database](https://echo.epa.gov/). In this project, we are building a web portal to share accessible data tools so the public can use ECHO data, to answer questions about polluting facilities in their areas of interest and draw attention to their findings.

EDGI has been working for a year on the Environmental Enforcement Watch Project with data analysts, nonprofits, and community groups to develop well-documented and open source cloud-based Jupyter Notebooks that make ECHO data readily accessible by zip code, hydrologic unit code (to assess watersheds), state, and congressional district. This project makes public for the first time a partner-hosted database that stitches together several of EPA’s datasets, opening up a more direct pathway to query for data science questions around the enforcement of environmental regulations. Our web portal will include new Notebooks that tutorialize how to access and query our database, and will create intuitive access to our existing Notebooks. This includes using UX testing and iterative design to make the Notebooks more readable at a novice level and to fund a web developer and web designer to expand our existing website.

## Learning Objectives
* Discover and prototype effective ways to engage the public with environmental enforcement data by conducting UX research and developing an interactive website to make the data and analytics more accessible. 
* Develop tutorials to teach the general public how to use a Jupyter Notebook to retrieve ECHO data and generate reports for their own use.
## Significance
* There has been a continuous pattern of insufficient enforcement of the nation’s environmental protection laws over the past 20 years. Accessible data on environmental permit enforcement means communities can take their concerns into their own hands and present evidence of insufficient enforcement to their elected representatives and the media. 
## Impact
* Demonstrate and prototype open source software for a more citizen science and community-based approach to environmental oversight than existing portals offered by the EPA.
* Invite members of the public to engage with environmental science data, letting them ask meaningful questions even at a novice level of data science and form critical questions of data quality that are often glossed over by the time “results” reach the public.
